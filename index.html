        <h3>The Impact of Twitter on Free Speech</h3>
        <img src="twfreespeech.jpeg" width="200" alt="free speech image" />
        <p>
          A lot of people today use twitter for different reasons. Some use it
          to keep up with latest news, some use it to post their controversial
          opinions, usually through "burner accounts", some people use it to
          promote their influencer lifestyle, modeling or business, some
          "trolls" use it to trigger and annoy other users, and some, like me
          use it for memes and to get a good laugh. Twitter has had a positive
          impact on freedom of speech in that it is a platform for people to
          voice out their controversial thoughts without getting censored. In
          fact, twitter threads facilitate discussion about controversial topics
          between groups with different views. It is also a platform for
          individuals to find communities that share similar interests and
          views. Twitter has also been used to protest unfair government
          practices and to raise awareness on issues going on around the world,
          for example twitter was used recently to amplify the voices of
          troubled Nigerians during the "End Sars" protests. Twitter has also
          had a negative, albeit insubstantial impact on freedom of speech in
          that it is possible to get "canceled" due to an opinion you post on
          twitter that most people do not agree with. Usually when people get
          canceled, they lose their jobs, endorsements and basically most
          sources of income they have. This fear of getting canceled could
          prevent a person from posting controversial opinions that they have,
          thereby indirectly limiting free speech. This is not much of an issue,
          though since canceling usually arises due to hate speech, racist
          comments, or just plain lack of respect for people. Therefore, twitter
          has mostly had a positive impact on freedom of speech.
